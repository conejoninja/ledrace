# Notes about the circuit

The schema should give a general idea of how to connect the parts. I use a female USB to power it, so a phone charger would work. And a male USB to power the board, in this case an Adafruit Circuit Playground Express. It might look a little bit complicated, but was made to be reusable, so you can connect a different board.

I use some [arcade buttons](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/5pcs-24mm-Arcade-LED-Light-Illuminated-Push-Button-Built-in-Switch-5V-Buttons-For-Arcade-Game/32858643564.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.5d5c4c4dmMsCqS) with integrated LEDs, but in the circuit are separated (Fritzing didn't have the part)

I also used some JST XH (2.54mm pin-to-pin pitch) connectors of 6 pins and two of 4 pins. The 4 pins connectors are used for the controllers to be de-attachable. The 6 pin connector is used between the adafruit circuit playground and the components, so I can change the board by another (an arduino for example) without the need to solder/de-solder anything.
